=== Description
// Describe what this Reference term does, and what it is used for	►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
Writes an analog value (http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM[PWM wave]) to a pin. Can be used to light a LED at varying brightnesses or drive a motor at various speeds. After a call to `analogWrite()`, the pin will generate a steady square wave of the specified duty cycle until the next call to `analogWrite()` (or a call to `digitalRead()` or `digitalWrite()` on the same pin). The frequency of the PWM signal on most pins is approximately 490 Hz. On the Uno and similar boards, pins 5 and 6 have a frequency of approximately 980 Hz.

[float]
=== Syntax
// Enter Reference term syntax, please specify all available parameters  ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
`analogWrite(pin, value)`


[float]
=== Parameters
// List all available parameters, please describe them one by one adding the data type (e.g int, boolean, char, String, float, long, double...)  ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY FOR FUNCTIONS ◄◄◄◄◄
`pin`: the number of the pin to write to. Allowed data types: int.

`value`: the duty cycle between 0 (always off) and 255 (always on). Allowed data types: int.


[float]
=== Returns
// Enter what the function returns (e.g. HIGH or LOW), if there is no return please write: _Nothing_   ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY FOR FUNCTIONS ◄◄◄◄◄

[float]
=== Example Code
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code   ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
Sets the output to the LED proportional to the value read from the potentiometer.

[source,arduino]
// Add relevant code that exemplify the use of the Reference term,
// Please note that sometimes when copy-pasting code, a few spaces can be added at the beginnng of each line of code.
// If that happens, please remove the extra spaces. Thanks!

int ledPin = 9;      // LED connected to digital pin 9
int analogPin = 3;   // potentiometer connected to analog pin 3
int val = 0;         // variable to store the read value

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);   // sets the pin as output
}

void loop() {
  val = analogRead(analogPin);   // read the input pin
  analogWrite(ledPin, val / 4);  // analogRead values go from 0 to 1023, analogWrite values from 0 to 255

=== Notes and Warnings
// Add useful notes, tips, caveat, known issues, and warnings about this Reference term
This is because of interactions with the `millis()` and `delay()` functions.
