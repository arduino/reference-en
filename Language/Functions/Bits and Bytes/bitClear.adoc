[float]
=== Syntax
`bitClear(x, n)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`x`: the numeric variable whose bit to clear. +
`n`: which bit to clear, starting at 0 for the least-significant (rightmost) bit.


[float]
=== Returns
`x`: the value of the numeric variable after the bit at position `n` is cleared.

[float]
=== Example Code
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code
Prints the output of `bitClear(x,n)` on two given integers. The binary representation of 6 is 0110, so when `n=1`, the second bit from the right is set to 0. After this we are left with 0100 in binary, so 4 is returned.
