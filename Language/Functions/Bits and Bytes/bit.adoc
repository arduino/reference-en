= bit()


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS
[#overview]

[float]
=== Description
Computes the value of the specified bit (bit 0 is 1, bit 1 is 2, bit 2 is 4, etc). The value returned is 2^n where n is an integer input.

[float]
=== Syntax
`bit(n)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`n`: the bit whose value to compute. Note that `n` needs to be between 0-31 (32 bit). 


[float]
=== Returns
The value of the bit.

=== Example Code
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code   ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
Prints the output of `bit(n)` for n=0 to n=10 to the serial monitor. Values returned are 1 2 4 8 16 till 1024.

void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop() {
for(int n=0;n<=10;n++)  //loop from n=0 till 10
  {
  Serial.print(" ");    //space between numbers, for readability
  Serial.print(bit(n)); //print the value of bit(n)
  delay(1000);
  }
}

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
The variable `n` must be an integer type. float and double will return an error and the program will not compile.

The maximum value that can be returned by `bit(n)` is 2^31 = 2147483648 after which 0 is returned.
