[float]
=== Description
Writes an analog value (http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM[PWM wave]) to a pin. Can be used to light a LED at varying brightnesses or drive a motor at various speeds. After a call to `analogWrite()`, the pin will generate a steady rectangular wave of the specified duty cycle until the next call to `analogWrite()` (or a call to `digitalRead()` or `digitalWrite()`) on the same pin.

{empty}* In addition to PWM capabilities on the pins noted above, the MKR, Nano 33 IoT, and Zero boards have true analog output when using `analogWrite()` on the `DAC0` (`A0`) pin. +
{empty}** In addition to PWM capabilities on the pins noted above, the Due has true analog output when using `analogWrite()` on pins `DAC0` and `DAC1`.

[%hardbreaks]

You do not need to call `pinMode()` to set the pin as an output before calling `analogWrite()`.
The `analogWrite` function has nothing to do with the analog pins or the `analogRead` function.

[float]
=== Syntax
`analogWrite(pin, value)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`pin`: the Arduino pin to write to. Allowed data types: `int`. +
`value`: the duty cycle: between 0 (always off) and 255 (always on). Allowed data types: `int`.


[float]
=== Returns
Nothing

[float]
=== Example Code
Sets the output to the LED proportional to the value read from the potentiometer.


[source,arduino]
----
int ledPin = 9;      // LED connected to digital pin 9
int analogPin = 3;   // potentiometer connected to analog pin 3
int val = 0;         // variable to store the read value

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // sets the pin as output
}

void loop() {
  val = analogRead(analogPin);  // read the input pin
  analogWrite(ledPin, val / 4); // analogRead values go from 0 to 1023, analogWrite values from 0 to 255
}

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
The PWM outputs generated on pins 5 and 6 will have higher-than-expected duty cycles. This is because of interactions with the `millis()` and `delay()` functions, which share the same internal timer used to generate those PWM outputs. This will be noticed mostly on low duty-cycle settings (e.g. 0 - 10) and may result in a value of 0 not fully turning off the output on pins 5 and 6.
