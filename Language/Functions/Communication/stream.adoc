=== Description
Stream is the base class for character and binary based streams. It is not called directly, but invoked whenever you use a function that relies on it.

Stream defines the reading functions in Arduino. When using any core functionality that uses a `read()` or similar method, you can safely assume it calls on the Stream class. For functions like `print()`, Stream inherits from the Print class.

Some of the libraries that rely on Stream include :
