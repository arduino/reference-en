[float]
=== Description
`readBytes()` read characters from a stream into a buffer. The function terminates if the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../streamsettimeout[setTimeout()]).

`readBytes()` returns the number of bytes placed in the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found.

This function is part of the Stream class, and is called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
