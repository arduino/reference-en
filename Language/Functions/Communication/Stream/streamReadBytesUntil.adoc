[float]
=== Description
`readBytesUntil()` reads characters from a stream into a buffer. The function terminates if the terminator character is detected, the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../streamsettimeout[setTimeout()]). The function returns the characters up to the last character before the supplied terminator. The terminator itself is not returned in the buffer.

`readBytesUntil()` returns the number of bytes placed in the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found.

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
