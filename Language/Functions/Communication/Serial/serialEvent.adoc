*Please note:* most modern boards do not support this method. See "Notes and Warnings" further below this article.

The Mega 2560 R3 has additional serial ports which can be accessed by adding the corresponding number at the end of the function.

----
void serialEvent1() {
  //statements

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
Please note that `serialEvent()` *does not work* on any modern Arduino boards. The only recognized boards to have support as of 2023/12/06 is the *UNO R3* and *Mega 2560 R3*, which are based on the ATmega328P and ATmega2560 chips. 

Instead, you can use the link:../available[`available()`] method. Examples in this page demonstrates how to read serial data only when it is available, which is exactly what `Serial.event()` does.
