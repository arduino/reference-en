[float]
=== Description
Writes binary data to the serial port. This data is sent as a byte or series of bytes; to send the characters representing the digits of a number use the link:../print[print()] function instead.

[float]
=== Syntax
`_Serial_.write(val)` +
`_Serial_.write(str)` +
`_Serial_.write(buf, len)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`_Serial_`: serial port object. See the list of available serial ports for each board on the link:https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/serial[Serial main page]. +
`val`: a value to send as a single byte. +
`str`: a string to send as a series of bytes. +
`buf`: an array to send as a series of bytes. +
`len`: the number of bytes to be sent from the array.


[float]
=== Returns
`write()` will return the number of bytes written, though reading that number is optional. Data type: `size_t`.

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.write(45); // send a byte with the value 45

  int bytesSent = Serial.write("hello");  //send the string "hello" and return the length of the string.

=== Notes and Warnings
Serial transmission is asynchronous. If there is enough empty space in the transmit buffer, `Serial.write()` will return before any characters are transmitted over serial. If the transmit buffer is full then `Serial.write()` will block until there is enough space in the buffer. To avoid blocking calls to `Serial.write()`, you can first check the amount of free space in the transmit buffer using link:../availableforwrite[availableForWrite()].
