[float]
=== Description
`Serial.parseFloat()` returns the first valid floating point number from the Serial buffer. `parseFloat()` is terminated by the first character that is not a floating point number. The function terminates if it times out (see link:../settimeout[Serial.setTimeout()]).

`Serial.parseFloat()` inherits from the link:../../stream[Stream] utility class.

=== Syntax
`_Serial_.parseFloat()` +
`_Serial_.parseFloat(lookahead)` +
`_Serial_.parseFloat(lookahead, ignore)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`_Serial_`: serial port object. See the list of available serial ports for each board on the link:../../serial[Serial main page]. +
`lookahead`: the mode used to look ahead in the stream for a floating point number. Allowed data types: `LookaheadMode`. Allowed `lookahead` values:

* `SKIP_ALL`: all characters other than a minus sign, decimal point, or digits are ignored when scanning the stream for a floating point number. This is the default mode.
* `SKIP_NONE`: Nothing is skipped, and the stream is not touched unless the first waiting character is valid.
* `SKIP_WHITESPACE`: Only tabs, spaces, line feeds, and carriage returns are skipped.

`ignore`: used to skip the indicated char in the search. Used for example to skip thousands divider. Allowed data types: `char`
