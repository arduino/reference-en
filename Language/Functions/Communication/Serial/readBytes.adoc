[float]
=== Description
`Serial.readBytes()` reads characters from the serial port into a buffer. The function terminates if the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../settimeout[Serial.settimeout()]).

`Serial.readBytes()` returns the number of characters placed in the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found.

`Serial.readBytes()` inherits from the link:../../stream[Stream] utility class.
