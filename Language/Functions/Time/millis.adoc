= millis()

// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS
[#overview]

[float]
=== Description
Returns the number of milliseconds passed since the Arduino board began running the current program. This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately 50 days.

[float]
=== Syntax
`time = millis()`


[float]
=== Parameters
None


[float]
=== Returns
Number of milliseconds passed since the program started. Data type: `unsigned long`.

[float]
=== Example Code
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code   ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
This example code prints on the serial port the number of milliseconds passed since the Arduino board started running the code itself.

[source,arduino]
----
unsigned long myTime;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
  Serial.print("Time: ");
  myTime = millis();

  Serial.println(myTime); // prints time since program started
  delay(1000);          // wait a second so as not to send massive amounts of data
}

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
Please note that the return value for millis() is of type `unsigned long`, logic errors may occur if a programmer tries to do arithmetic with smaller data types such as `int`. Even signed `long` may encounter errors as its maximum value is half that of its unsigned counterpart.
