=== Description
`analogWriteResolution()` is an extension of the Analog API for the Arduino Due.

`analogWriteResolution()` sets the resolution of the `analogWrite()` function. It defaults to 8 bits (values between 0-255) for backward compatibility with AVR based boards.

The *Due* has the following hardware capabilities:

* 12 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. These can be changed to 12-bit resolution.
* 2 pins with 12-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)

By setting the write resolution to 12, you can use `analogWrite()` with values between 0 and 4095 to exploit the full DAC resolution or to set the PWM signal without rolling over.

The *GIGA R1 WiFi* has the following hardware capabilities:

* 12 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. 
* 2 pins with 12-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)


The *Zero* has the following hardware capabilities:

* 10 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. These can be changed to 12-bit resolution.
* 1 pin with 10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter).

By setting the write resolution to 10, you can use `analogWrite()` with values between 0 and 1023 to exploit the full DAC resolution


The *MKR Family* of boards has the following hardware capabilities:

* 4 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. These can be changed from 8 (default) to 12-bit resolution.
* 1 pin with 10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)

By setting the write resolution to 12 bits, you can use `analogWrite()` with values between 0 and 4095 for PWM signals; set 10 bit on the DAC pin to exploit the full DAC resolution of 1024 values.

[float]
=== Syntax
`analogWriteResolution(bits)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`bits`: determines the resolution (in bits) of the values used in the `analogWrite()` function. The value can range from 1 to 32. If you choose a resolution higher or lower than your board's hardware capabilities, the value used in `analogWrite()` will be either truncated if it's too high or padded with zeros if it's too low. See the note below for details.

=== Returns
Nothing

  // change the PWM resolution to 12 bits
  // the full 12 bit resolution is only supported
  // on the Due

  Serial.print(map(sensorVal, 0, 1023, 0, 4095));

  // change the PWM resolution to 4 bits
  analogWriteResolution(4);
  analogWrite(13, map(sensorVal, 0, 1023, 0, 15));
  Serial.print(", 4-bit PWM value : ");
  Serial.println(map(sensorVal, 0, 1023, 0, 15));

  delay(5);

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
If you set the `analogWriteResolution()` value to a value higher than your board's capabilities, the Arduino will discard the extra bits. For example: using the Due with `analogWriteResolution(16)` on a 12-bit DAC pin, only the first 12 bits of the values passed to `analogWrite()` will be used and the last 4 bits will be discarded.

If you set the `analogWriteResolution()` value to a value lower than your board's capabilities, the missing bits will be *padded with zeros* to fill the hardware required size. For example: using the Due with analogWriteResolution(8) on a 12-bit DAC pin, the Arduino will add 4 zero bits to the 8-bit value used in `analogWrite()` to obtain the 12 bits required.
