=== Description
The keyboard functions enable 32u4 or SAMD micro based boards to send keystrokes to an attached computer through their micro's native USB port.
[%hardbreaks]
*Note: Not every possible ASCII character, particularly the non-printing ones, can be sent with the Keyboard library.* +
The library supports the use of modifier keys. Modifier keys change the behavior of another key when pressed simultaneously. link:../keyboard/keyboardmodifiers[See here] for additional information on supported keys and their use.

=== Notes and Warnings
These core libraries allow the 32u4 and SAMD based boards (Leonardo, Esplora, Zero, Due and MKR Family) to appear as a native Mouse and/or Keyboard to a connected computer.
[%hardbreaks]
*A word of caution on using the Mouse and Keyboard libraries*: if the Mouse or Keyboard library is constantly running, it will be difficult to program your board. Functions such as `Mouse.move()` and `Keyboard.print()` will move your cursor or send keystrokes to a connected computer and should only be called when you are ready to handle them. It is recommended to use a control system to turn this functionality on, like a physical switch or only responding to specific input you can control.
[%hardbreaks]
When using the Mouse or Keyboard library, it may be best to test your output first using `Serial.print()`. This way, you can be sure you know what values are being reported. Refer to the Mouse and Keyboard examples for some ways to handle this.
