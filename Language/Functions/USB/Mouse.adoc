=== Description
The mouse functions enable 32u4 or SAMD micro based boards to control cursor movement on a connected computer through their micro's native USB port. When updating the cursor position, it is always relative to the cursor's previous location.

=== Notes and Warnings
These core libraries allow the 32u4 and SAMD based boards (Leonardo, Esplora, Zero, Due and MKR Family) to appear as a native Mouse and/or Keyboard to a connected computer.
[%hardbreaks]
*A word of caution on using the Mouse and Keyboard libraries*: if the Mouse or Keyboard library is constantly running, it will be difficult to program your board. Functions such as `Mouse.move()` and `Keyboard.print()` will move your cursor or send keystrokes to a connected computer and should only be called when you are ready to handle them. It is recommended to use a control system to turn this functionality on, like a physical switch or only responding to specific input you can control. Refer to the Mouse and Keyboard examples for some ways to handle this.
[%hardbreaks]
When using the Mouse or Keyboard library, it may be best to test your output first using link:../../communication/serial/print[Serial.print()]. This way, you can be sure you know what values are being reported.
