[float]
=== Description
Shifts out a byte of data one bit at a time. Starts from either the most (i.e. the leftmost) or least (rightmost) significant bit. Each bit is written in turn to a data pin, after which a clock pin is pulsed (taken high, then low) to indicate that the bit is available.

Note- if you're interfacing with a device that's clocked by rising edges, you'll need to make sure that the clock pin is low before the call to `shiftOut()`, e.g. with a call to `digitalWrite(clockPin, LOW)`.

This is a software implementation; see also the https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI[SPI library], which provides a hardware implementation that is faster but works only on specific pins.

[float]
=== Syntax
`shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, bitOrder, value)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`dataPin`: the pin on which to output each bit. Allowed data types: `int`. +
`clockPin`: the pin to toggle once the dataPin has been set to the correct value. Allowed data types: `int`. +
`bitOrder`: which order to shift out the bits; either MSBFIRST or LSBFIRST. (Most Significant Bit First, or, Least Significant Bit First). +
`value`: the data to shift out. Allowed data types: `byte`.


[float]
=== Returns
Nothing

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
The dataPin and clockPin must already be configured as outputs by a call to link:../../digital-io/pinmode[pinMode()].

shiftOut is currently written to output 1 byte (8 bits) so it requires a two step operation to output values larger than 255.

----
// Do this for MSBFIRST serial
int data = 500;
// shift out highbyte
shiftOut(dataPin, clock, MSBFIRST, (data >> 8));
// shift out lowbyte
shiftOut(dataPin, clock, MSBFIRST, data);

// Or do this for LSBFIRST serial
data = 500;
// shift out lowbyte
shiftOut(dataPin, clock, LSBFIRST, data);
// shift out highbyte
shiftOut(dataPin, clock, LSBFIRST, (data >> 8));
