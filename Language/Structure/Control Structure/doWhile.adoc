=== Description
[%hardbreaks]
The `do...while` loop works in the same manner as the link:../while[while] loop, with the exception that the condition is tested at the end of the loop, so the do loop will always run at least once.

[float]
=== Syntax
[source,arduino]
----
do
{
    // statement block
} while (condition);
----
The `condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
