=== Description
The `if...else` allows greater control over the flow of code than the basic link:../if[if] statement, by allowing multiple tests to be grouped together. An `else` clause (if at all exists) will be executed if the condition in the `if` statement results in `false`. The `else` can proceed another `if` test, so that multiple, mutually exclusive tests can be run at the same time.
[%hardbreaks]

Each test will proceed to the next one until a true test is encountered. When a true test is found, its associated block of code is run, and the program then skips to the line following the entire if/else construction. If no test proves to be true, the default `else` block is executed, if one is present, and sets the default behavior.
[%hardbreaks]

Note that an `else if` block may be used with or without a terminating `else` block and vice versa. An unlimited number of such `else if` branches is allowed.

=== Example Code
Below is an extract from a code for temperature sensor system
[source,arduino]
----
if (temperature >= 70)
{
  //Danger! Shut down the system
}
else if (temperature >= 60 && temperature < 70)
{
  //Warning! User attention required
}
else
{
  //Safe! Continue usual tasks...
