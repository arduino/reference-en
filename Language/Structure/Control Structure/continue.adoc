=== Description
[%hardbreaks]
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop (link:../for[for], link:../while[while], or link:../dowhile[do...while]). It continues by checking the conditional expression of the loop, and proceeding with any subsequent iterations.

=== Example Code
The following code writes the value of 0 to 255 to the `PWMpin`, but skips the values in the range of 41 to 119.

for (x = 0; x <= 255; x ++)
{
    if (x > 40 && x < 120){      // create jump in values
        continue;
    }

    analogWrite(PWMpin, x);
    delay(50);
}
