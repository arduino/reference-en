=== Notes and Warnings
The use of `goto` is discouraged in C++ programming, and some authors of C++ programming books claim that the `goto` statement is never necessary, but used judiciously, it can simplify certain programs. The reason that many programmers frown upon the use of goto is that with the unrestrained use of `goto` statements, it is easy to create a program with undefined program flow, which can never be debugged.

With that said, there are instances where a `goto` statement can come in handy, and simplify coding. One of these situations is to break out of deeply nested link:../for[for] loops, or link:../if[if] logic blocks, on a certain condition.

It should be considered that - as opposed to functions - a "goto"-code can never return to its calling point. So instead of using the "goto"-control, it is advisable to "break" or "continue" the nested structures and define and call a function instead.
