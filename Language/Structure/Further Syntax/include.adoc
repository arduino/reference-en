=== Description
`#include` is used to include outside libraries in your sketch. This gives the programmer access to a large group of standard C libraries (groups of pre-made functions), and also libraries written especially for Arduino.
[%hardbreaks]

The main reference page for AVR C libraries (AVR is a reference to the Atmel chips on which the Arduino is based) is http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/modules.html[here^].
[%hardbreaks]

Note that `#include`, similar to link:../define[`#define`], has no semicolon terminator, and the compiler will yield cryptic error messages if you add one.

=== Example Code
This example includes a library that is used to put data into the program space _flash_ instead of _ram_. This saves the ram space for dynamic memory needs and makes large lookup tables more practical.
