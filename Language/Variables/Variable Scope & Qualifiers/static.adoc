[float]
=== Description
The `static` keyword is used to create variables that are visible to only one function. However, unlike local variables that get created and destroyed every time a function is called, static variables persist beyond the function call, preserving their data between function calls.

Variables declared as static will only be created and initialized the first time a function is called.

/* RandomWalk
  Paul Badger 2007
  RandomWalk wanders up and down randomly between two
  endpoints. The maximum move in one loop is governed by
  the parameter "stepsize".
  A static variable is moved up and down a random amount.
  This technique is also known as "pink noise" and "drunken walk".
*/

  Serial.begin(9600);

  thisTime = randomWalk(stepsize);

}

int randomWalk(int moveSize) {
  static int place; // variable to store value in random walk - declared static so that it stores
  // values in between function calls, but no other functions can change its value

  place = place + (random(-moveSize, moveSize + 1));

  if (place < randomWalkLowRange) {                               // check lower and upper limits
    place = randomWalkLowRange + (randomWalkLowRange - place);    // reflect number back in positive direction
