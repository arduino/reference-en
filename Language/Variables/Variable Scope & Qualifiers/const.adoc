= const keyword


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS
[#overview]

[float]
=== Description
The `const` keyword stands for constant. It is a variable _qualifier_ that modifies the behavior of the variable, making a variable "_read-only_". This means that the variable can be used just as any other variable of its type, but its value cannot be changed. You will get a compiler error if you try to assign a value to a `const` variable.

Constants defined with the const keyword obey the rules of link:https://cdn.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/variable-scope--qualifiers/scope/[variable scoping] that govern other variables. This, and the pitfalls of using#define, makes the const keyword a superior method for defining constants and is preferred over using link:https://cdn.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/further-syntax/define/[[#define].

const float pi = 3.14;
float x;

// ....

x = pi * 2;    // it's fine to use const's in math

pi = 7;        // illegal - you can't write to (modify) a constant

=== Notes and Warnings
*`#define` or `const`*

You can use either `const` or `#define` for creating numeric or string constants. For link:https://cdn.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/array/[arrays], you will need to use `const`. In general `const` is preferred over `#define` for defining constants.
