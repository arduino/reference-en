= const keyword

=== Description
The `const` keyword stands for constant. It is a variable _qualifier_ that modifies the behavior of the variable, making a variable "_read-only_". This means that the variable can be used just as any other variable of its type, but its value cannot be changed. You will get a compiler error if you try to assign a value to a `const` variable.

Constants defined with the `const` keyword obey the rules of link:../scope[variable scoping] that govern other variables. This, and the pitfalls of using link:../../../structure/further-syntax/define[`#define`], makes the `const` keyword a superior method for defining constants and is preferred over using link:../../../structure/further-syntax/define[`#define`].

const float pi = 3.14;
float x;

// ....

x = pi * 2;    // it's fine to use consts in math

pi = 7;        // illegal - you can't write to (modify) a constant

=== Notes and Warnings
*link:../../../structure/further-syntax/define[`#define`] or `const`*

You can use either `const` or link:../../../structure/further-syntax/define[`#define`] for creating numeric or string constants. For link:../../data-types/array[arrays], you will need to use `const`. In general `const` is preferred over link:../../../structure/further-syntax/define[`#define`] for defining constants.
