== Defining Digital Pins modes: INPUT, INPUT_PULLUP, and OUTPUT
Digital pins can be used as `INPUT`, `INPUT_PULLUP`, or `OUTPUT`. Changing a pin with link:../../../functions/digital-io/pinmode[`pinMode()`] changes the electrical behavior of the pin.

=== INPUT
Arduino (ATmega) pins configured as `INPUT` with link:../../../functions/digital-io/pinmode[`pinMode()`] are said to be in a _high-impedance_ state. Pins configured as `INPUT` make extremely small demands on the circuit that they are sampling, equivalent to a series resistor of 100 Megohms in front of the pin. This makes them useful for reading a sensor.

If you have your pin configured as an `INPUT`, and are reading a switch, when the switch is in the open state the input pin will be "floating", resulting in unpredictable results. In order to assure a proper reading when the switch is open, a pull-up or pull-down resistor must be used. The purpose of this resistor is to pull the pin to a known state when the switch is open. A 10 K ohm resistor is usually chosen, as it is a low enough value to reliably prevent a floating input, and at the same time a high enough value to not draw too much current when the switch is closed. See the http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalReadSerial[Digital Read Serial^] tutorial for more information.

If a pull-down resistor is used, the input pin will be `LOW` when the switch is open and `HIGH` when the switch is closed.

If a pull-up resistor is used, the input pin will be `HIGH` when the switch is open and `LOW` when the switch is closed.

=== INPUT_PULLUP
The ATmega microcontroller on the Arduino has internal pull-up resistors (resistors that connect to power internally) that you can access. If you prefer to use these instead of external pull-up resistors, you can use the `INPUT_PULLUP` argument in link:../../../functions/digital-io/pinmode[`pinMode()`].

See the http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/InputPullupSerial[Input Pullup Serial^] tutorial for an example of this in use.

Pins configured as inputs with either `INPUT` or `INPUT_PULLUP` can be damaged or destroyed if they are connected to voltages below ground (negative voltages) or above the positive power rail (5V or 3V).

[float]
=== OUTPUT
Pins configured as `OUTPUT` with link:../../../functions/digital-io/pinmode[`pinMode()`] are said to be in a _low-impedance_ state. This means that they can provide a substantial amount of current to other circuits. ATmega pins can source (provide current) or sink (absorb current) up to 40 mA (milliamps) of current to other devices/circuits. This makes them useful for powering LEDs because LEDs typically use less than 40 mA. Loads greater than 40 mA (e.g. motors) will require a transistor or other interface circuitry.

Pins configured as outputs can be damaged or destroyed if they are connected to either the ground or positive power rails.
